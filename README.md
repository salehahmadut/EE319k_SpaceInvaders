-generated rows of aliens & added a function AlienMove() to make aliens move from side to side.

-doesnt do anything else, can prob use this code later once we hav other stuff working

-added player struct/spaceship that moves by taking input from slider

-value fluctuates a bit, will prob implement hardware averaging later to make it more stable

-will try to add buttons/missile firing mechanism later tonight

4/29 3:14 AM

-implemented button to shoot missile from spaceship (still need to make it edge triggered)

-once collisions are implemented (hopefully tmrw), basics of game engine will be done and we can polish up the game from there

-collisions work, function isnt very general so will fix that later (won't work if alien layout is different)

-need to add sound, make button edge triggered, add timer stuff
